Duckstermination!

Goal: create a game similar to Duck Hunt with a twist of having a gun at the bottom of
the screen that the user controls and rotates with the left and right arrow keys. The 
gun will fire bullets when the spacebar is pressed. However, the gun only has 15 bullets. 
Once a bullet collides with a duck that flys onto the screen, the duck is destroyed, and 
the player gains 50 points. Once a player exceeds 500 points, they receive 30 bullets and
are able to fire twice as fast. Once the player gets to 1000 points, the background 
changes, and 30 more bullets are given. Once the player gets to 2000 points, they win.
If the player runs out of bullets, they lose.
